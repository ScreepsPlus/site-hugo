## Hosted Graphs

![Graph Image](/images/graphs.png)

### How does it work?
So you may be wondering, "Why would I trust my Screeps login to someone else?" 
Great news! You don't have to, ScreepsPlus uses an agent based approach, 
a small program runs on your PC, a Pi, or whatever. That agent connects to
screeps.com and downloads your stats, it then sends those stats here for the graphing software.

### Want your own graphs?
There are two methods:

#### Easy (Hosted Agent)
With this method you do have to provide a token from MMO or password for a private server but you don't have to run anything permanently yourself.

1. Signup with the link on the left
2. Setup the [Hosted Agent]({{< ref "/services/hosted-agent" >}})
  This is my setup to pull from segment 30, it also adds a prefix of `shard2` to the stat path. That can be left blank for no prefix.

3. Visit [Grafana](/grafana)
4. Thats it! Create a dashboard and enjoy :)

#### Advanced
For more advanced stat collection and custom agents (Such as [NodeJS Agent](https://github.com/screepsplus/node-agent) or [Go Agent](https://github.com/screepsplus/go-agent)), you can PM psy3727 or ask in #screepsplus-support on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/screeps) with your screepsplus username for a token.
