On January 21st, 2021 ScreepsPlus private server infrastructure 
suffered an outage that resulted in the databases being lost. 
Instead of recovering from backup we decided to just 
delay restoration of services until the planned reset dates 
had been reached. Currently ScreepsPlus Seasonal Server is up 
and fully operational with ScreepsPlus Standard Server set to 
be reset this coming weekend. 

We have a few new services in the R&D phase that we hope to roll
out in the near future that will give ScreepsPlus users more 
options and capabilities in enjoying their Screeps experience.

Come join us on slack for up to date information or just to chat
about your ScreepsPlus activities.
