## Botarena
The BotArena is a regular competition between fully automated Screeps AIs. It is the ultimate test of your Screeps code. There is no luck with being online at the right time, your bot has to make every decision by itself with the sole exception of where the initial spawn goes.

All players with a fully automated AI are invited to participate.

Rules are subject to change, stay up to date in #botarena in the screeps slack.
